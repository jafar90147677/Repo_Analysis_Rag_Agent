I can’t make repository changes or fix the tracking setup while in Ask mode, so I can only guide you.

You need to set an upstream before `git pull`. Run:
```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
```
(or substitute the appropriate remote/branch if it’s not `origin/master`). After that `git pull` will work.

If you actually want me to make the change for you, please switch out of Ask mode so I can run the necessary commands.
